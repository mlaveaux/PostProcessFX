Enable additional post processing effects such as bloom, lensflare, different anti aliasing options and ambient occlusion.

[h1] Bloom and lensflare [/h1]

Can be fully controlled with the ingame UI with the following settings:

    - Enable Bloom: Enables the bloom effect.
    - Intensity: The intensity of the bloom effect.
    - Threshold: Lower means bloom occurs with lower light intensity.
    - Spread: The amount that the bloom is blurred.
    - Blur Iteration: Higher iterations cause a more smoothed blur.

    - Enable Lensflare: Enables a lens flare effect.
    - Intensity: The intensity of the lensflare effect.
    - Threshhold: Lower means that less bloom is needed to create lensflare.
    - Saturation: Higher saturation makes the lensflare more like the light color.
    - Rotation: In which rotation the lensflare expands.
    - Width: The width of the lensflare effect.
    - Blur Iterations: Higher iterations cause a more smoothed lens flare ends.
    - Style: Different lens flare styles.

[h1] Anti Aliasing [/h1]

Supports FXAA and SMAA.

    - FXAA is Fast Approximate Anti Aliasing.
        - Five presets ranging from very low to ultra.

    - SMAA is Enhanced Subpixel Morphological Antialiasing 
        - Four presets ranging from low to ultra.
        - Enable Temporal: Enables SMAA T2x, this setting causes some flickering however.
        
    - NOTE: Temporal only works with bloom enabled (You can set intensity to zero and have to toggle bloom once after enabling temporal).

Not as effective as the DynamicResolution mod, but cheaper and can be combined if desired.

[h1] Screen Space Ambient Occlusion [/h1]

This is different implementation then the other SSAO mod, so chose one depending on preference.

    - Intensity: How much the surfaces are darkened.
    - Radius: Controls the spread of the occlusion.
    - Sample Count: The amount of samples taken around each pixel, impacts performance.
    - Occlusion: Either depth or depth + normal is used, looks slightly different.
    - Enable Downsampling: Only sample at half resolution, impacts performance.

[h1] Additional Information [/h1]

All effects can be disabled so they don't have any performance impact. An ingame UI is provided to tweak the options and can be toggled with F9 (default), the toggle key can be changed in UI.
